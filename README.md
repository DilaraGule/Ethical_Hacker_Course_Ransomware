# Ethical_Hacker_Course_Ransomware
 
It is illegal to use on real machines! This project was developed both to understand the logic of ransomware and to practice the python language.

Both python files in the folder are run separately. To see the attack, first run "ransom.py", then "ransomdecrypter.py". It can be run not only for Linux, but also for Windows.
